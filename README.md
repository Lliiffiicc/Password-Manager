# Password-Manager
This program works as a website login page in which multiple accounts are created. A highly secure 8-character password is generated for each account made. 
These username and passwords are saved in a user database as a dictionary. When creating the account, if the username already exists in the database, it prompts for another username to generate password for.  

In order to log in to the website, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is required, for added security measures. Login is denied if either username or password or 2FA OTP does not match.

Since many accounts are created, if a user wants to access their usernames and passwords, they can open a password manager which stores all the login information.
The password manager allows the user to also edit/delete the login information as well.
