# Password-Manager
This program works as a website login page in which multiple accounts are created. A highly secure 8-character password is generated for each account made.
These username and passwords are saved in a user database as a dictionary.
In order to log in to the website, Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is required, for added security measures.

Since many accounts are created, if a user wants to access their usernames and passwords, they can access a password manager which stores the login information
The password manager allows the user to also edit/delete the login information as well.
